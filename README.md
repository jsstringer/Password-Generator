# Password-Generator

I was tasked with creating a password genrator for our week three project that combined HTML, CSS & Javascript.
It's designed to create a random password with a length determend by the user & the options to select 
Lowercase, Uppercase, Numbers & Special Characters.

Once the user has selected the length & Options the Javascript will run & give the user a random password that they can 
then copy to there clipboard & user it when nesseccery.

Javascript used to make this code variables, functions, forloop, onclick events, console log, & math.floor calculations.
